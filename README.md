End-to-end data analysis pipeline: from raw data processing to statistical modeling and presentation
# Comprehensive Data Science Analysis

## Project Overview
This project represents a full research cycle conducted for the *Data Laboratory* course at UBA. It processes a real-world dataset regarding **people's tweets about covid vaccination** to answer specific statistical questions through modeling and visualization.

## Repository Contents
* `main_analysis.ipynb`: The core research notebook containing data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.
* `research_presentation.ipynb`: A technical slide deck summarizing the findings and methodology for a broad audience.

## Technical Methodology
1.  **Data Curation:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering to prepare the raw dataset from tweeter api's
2.  **Statistical Analysis:** Applying pysentimiento library to validate assumptions.
3.  **Visualization:** Creating actionable insights using data visualization libraries (Matplotlib/Seaborn).

## Research Skills
This repository demonstrates the ability to:
* **Move from Idea to Prototype:** Taking a raw dataset and producing a functional analysis model.
* **Communicate Complexity:** Synthesizing technical results into clear narratives (via the Presentation notebook).
